# Cardmarket wizard

Improved cardmarket shopping wizard! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
Find the best combination of sellers for cards on your wants lists. ü™Ñ

This project is inspired by and in part based on [cw-wizard](https://github.com/BenSouchet/cw-wizard). Check it out!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notice ‚ö†Ô∏è

This project is discontinued, because it is no longer possible to skip cardmarket's cloudflare protection by using cookies from another browser.  
I am exploring ways around this, which will be implemented in a re-write of this project.

## Features

- Browse your wants lists. ‚úÖ
- Find the best prices. ‚úÖ
- Supports all card games on cardmarket. ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently only Yu-Gi-Oh!.
- Open Source, MIT Licensed. Clean, easy to read code. ‚úÖ

## Installation & Running

You need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed.

Install production dependencies:

```bash
poetry install --without dev
```

Run the application:

```bash
poetry run python -m cm_wizard
```

## Development

Install dependencies (including development dependencies) and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install
```

Run with hot reload (meaning the application reloads after code changes):

```bash
poetry run flet run -m -r cm_wizard
```

### Tests

```bash
poetry run pytest tests
```

### Code Analysis

Manually run all pre-commit hooks:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

Or run them individually:

- Static type checks: `poetry run mypy .`
- Sort imports: `poetry run isort .`
- Format code: `poetry run black .`
